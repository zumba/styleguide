	+ Tab once, no spaces
	+ One line space between media queries or nested element
	+ No inline properties
	+ We never style IDâ€™s only Classes
	+ Try to code in the order in which the elements are dsiplayed in the markup
	+ Keep nesting down to a minimum and no deeper than 4 levels including pseudo selectors
	+ Media queries go after properties and the order should reflect mobile first
